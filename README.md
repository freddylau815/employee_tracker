# Employee Tracker

## Description
In this project, I developed a command-line application to manage a comapny's database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This application contains functions that can list departments, roles, and employees, as well as enable the addition of departments, roles, and employees. Also, the application can update an existing employee's role.
